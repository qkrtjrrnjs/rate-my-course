## Overview
### Description
We are making a service to allow students to rate classes, similar to RateMyProfessor. We are going to limit classes to Purdue CS courses to simplify it for a demo.

**Category:** Education
**Mobile:** real-time, audio
**Story:** The value of this idea is high to students looking to take certain classes. Potentially, other students would be able to use the app and would respond positively.
**Market:** The market is all Purdue CS students, which is relatively small but we could potentially cater to that audience. This is more of a niche service.
**Habit:** The frequency of the app's use depends on the user. consume & create
**Scope:** The service isn't particularly complex. We only include Purdue CS courses, which we can create a back-end for by Demo Day.
